### Built with


- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### Continued development

At start was really difficult to understand all the dimensions and syntaxes, I need to focus in learning all the methods to modify boxes and align/justify them

### Useful resources

- [Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me understanding screen sizes. I really liked this responsive design and will use it going forward.
- [CSS Text](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_text_spacing.asp) - This is an amazing site which helped me understand css text . I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
